This (currently Windows-specific) program edits the hosts file to block certain websites for a specified number of hours. It must be run the whole time, or re-run again with an input of zero hours, for it to automatically unblock the sites after the time is up.

I highly recommend you back up your hosts file before running this program. It can be found here on Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.
